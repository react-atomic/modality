/**
 * `--trace` — the dispatch tracer.
 *
 * A CLI that misbehaves usually misbehaves *before* the handler runs: the wrong
 * command resolved, an env var injected a format flag, an arg coerced to
 * something unexpected, or a `methodsDir` pointed somewhere stale. None of that
 * is visible from the outside — the runner resolves, validates and dispatches
 * silently, and all the reader sees is the result.
 *
 * This module turns that path into output, but only when `--trace` is passed.
 * Silence is the contract: with the flag absent the tracer is inert, `step()`
 * builds no strings, and not one byte reaches the terminal.
 *
 * ## Why stderr
 *
 * Trace lines go to **stderr**, never stdout. A kit CLI's stdout is a data
 * channel — `--json` envelopes, and the `merge` command exists precisely to
 * fold a piped chain of them into one document. Tracing to stdout would corrupt
 * every one of those pipelines, so `cli cmd --json --trace | jq` stays valid and
 * the trace still shows up on the terminal.
