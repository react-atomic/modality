/**
 * Default commands — the ones {@link createCliRunner} registers on a CLI's
 * behalf, so every kit-based CLI gets them without declaring anything.
 *
 * Adding one is a change to this folder alone: drop the module into
 * `commands/` beside `merge.ts` — one command per file, one export each, as
 * `commands/__tests__/exports.test.ts` enforces — and add its factory to
 * {@link DEFAULT_COMMANDS}. This file is the only place they are wired
 * together, which is why it sits outside `commands/`. The runner reads
 * the map, the `DefaultCommandName` union widens automatically, and the
 * `withoutDefaultCommand` option accepts the new name with no further wiring.
 *
 * Each factory receives a {@link DefaultCommandContext}, so a default command
 * can tailor its help to the CLI it lands in — and can decline to register at
 * all (return `undefined`) when that CLI supplies nothing for it to work on.
