/**
 * `skill` — print the raw skill text for a Counter method.
 *
 * A CLI whose repo carries a Counter `methods/` tree gets this for free: point
 * {@link CliRunnerOptions.methodsDir} at that tree and the runner registers the
 * command, help and all.
 *
 * ```bash
 * my-cli skill                       # list available methods
 * my-cli skill create-trade-plan     # print one method's skill text
 * my-cli skill <method> --help       # that method's own help
 * my-cli skill <method> --refs       # that method's references
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why this command validates its own argv
 *
 * A method's valid flags are its own: `create-trade-plan` takes `--trigger`,
 * another method takes something else entirely, and Counter forwards whatever
 * it finds as that method's `params`. No static `inputSchema` can describe
 * that, so the runner hands this command raw argv — a privilege it grants
 * only to commands the kit itself wrote (see `defaultCommands/internal`).
 *
 * The argv is not therefore unchecked. Each method declares its parameters in
 * its own MDX, and {@link buildMethodParamsSchema} turns that declaration into
 * a real Zod schema, applied here before Counter is called. An undeclared
 * parameter is rejected; a method that declares none accepts none. That is
 * stricter than Counter alone, which forwards any `--key value` it sees.
 *
 * Validation reads the args but never rewrites them. The only argv that never
 * reaches Counter is the CLI's own global flags (`--json`, `--human`, …),
 * which the runner strips before the command sees them — so the only change in
 * behavior is that bad input now stops here instead of reaching the method.
 *
 * `@modality-counter/core` is an *optional* dependency, imported lazily below.
 * A CLI that never sets `methodsDir` never registers this command and never
 * loads Counter — so the kit stays installable without it.
