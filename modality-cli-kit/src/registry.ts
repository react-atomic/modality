/**
 * Command registry — the single place a CLI wires its commands and aliases.
 *
 * Each command is a self-contained `CLICommand`; the registry resolves names
 * and aliases to the right command and dispatches to its `execute`.
 *
 * A command's aliases may come from either side. The alias map passed here is
 * authoritative for every command it names; a command not named there
 * contributes its own `aliases` field instead. Declaring them on the command is
 * what lets `createCommandRegistryFromDir` work from a directory alone — the
 * file is the command's only declaration, so deleting it removes its aliases
 * too and no central map can be left pointing at a command that is gone.
 *
 * ## Quick start
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { createCommandRegistry } from "modality-cli-kit";
 * import { fooCommand } from "./commands/foo";
 * import { barCommand } from "./commands/bar";
 *
 * export const registry = createCommandRegistry(
 *   [fooCommand, barCommand],
 *   { foo: ["f"], bar: ["b", "baz"] },
 * );
 *
 * registry.get("baz")?.name;           // → "bar"
 * await registry.execute("foo", { target: "x" });
 * ```

 * Outcome of {@link CommandRegistry.resolve}. On success it carries the
